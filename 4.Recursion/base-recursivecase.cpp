// it is technique where function call itself directly or indirectly to solve problem
//two parts of recursive function:
//1. Base case(the stopping condition) : it tells when to stop 
 // for ex: if(n==0) return ; without it function call itself  infinite times


//2. Recursive case: it tells what to do next
// the part where the funciton calls itself with a smaller problem
// for ex: return func(n-1); each call should move closer to the base case;
// so that eventually we reach the base case


//ex: print number 5 to 1
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

void print(int n){
    if(n==0) return;
    cout<<n<<" ";
    print(n-1);
}


//without basecase:
void fun(){
    cout<<"hello";
    fun();
}
//runs forever until stack overflow because the function never stop calling itself


void countdown(int n){
    if(n==0){
        cout<<"done\n";
        return;
    }
    cout<<n<<" ";
    countdown(n-1);
}
int main(){
    print(5);
    int n=5;
    countdown(n);
    return 0;
}




//call stack: memory space where function calls are stored temporarily
// it follow LIFO rule(last in first out)
//each function call has its own call stack
// when a fucntion is called , its pushed onto the stack.
// when a fucntion finishes execution, it is popped off the stack.
// call stack is used to keep track of function calls and their return values

//in simple word: call stack is a stack of functions that are currently being executed


//whenever a function is called:
//- a new stack frame is created.
// - the stack frame is pushed onto the call stack
// - when the fucntion finishes  its frame is removed from the call stack(popped)

//what does a stack frame store:
// each stack frame store the local variables of the function, function parameters, return address, execution state of the function

//call stack in recursion: 
//-in recursion a fucntion calls itself repeatedly
// for every recursive call:
// a new stackframe is pushed onto the stack
// the previous function call waits until the new call completes
// after reaching the base case, function start returning one by one

// ex:
int fact(int n){
    if(n==1) return 1;
    return n*fact(n-1);
}

//function call fact(4):
//creates fact(4) -> fact(3) -> fact(2)-> fact(1) 
//stack growth(lifo) -> fact(1) -> fact(2) -> fact(3) -> fact(4)
//returning phase: base case reached fact(1)=1;
//now stack start popping
// fact(2)-> 2*1=2; fact(3)-> 3*2=6; fact(4)->4*6=24

//visualization:
//calling phase:  fact(4)->fact(3)->fact(2)->fact(1)
//returning phase: fact(1)->1; fact(2)->2*1=2; fact(3)->3*2=6; fact(4)->4*6=24

//why call stack important?
//- it helps recursion remember current function state, variable values, pending operations, where executions should continue after a function returns
//without the call stack recursive function cannot work


//stack overflow: when there is no base condition and functin calls itself infinite times
void fun(){
    fun();
}

//the call stack keep growing until memory is exhausted

//recursive tree: a tree like diagram that represent all recusrive function calls generated during execution each node represent a functin call and branches represent further recursive calls until the base case is reached


//Call Stack = How recursion runs
// Recursion Tree = How recursion branches
